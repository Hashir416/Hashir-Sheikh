        <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Hashir Sheikh and I am a 3rd year student at Ontario Tech University. 
            I'm working towards a Bachelor's in Information Technology.

            On this page, I will be sharing some projects that am working on outside of school, 
            some interesting facts about me, some of my hobbies, and there is also a contact form
            for you all to reach me with. 

            This is my first time building a website using HTML and CSS, and I am very excited to 
            see what the future holds in terms of Web Development.
