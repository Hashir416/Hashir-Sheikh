                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>I started playing basketball in 8th grade, and I've never stopped since. I've gotten much better at it over the years and even branched out new 
                    healthy hobbies because of it, such as weightlifting. I played basketball competitively on my high school team, and even played in an adult 
                    league this past summer. I see it as an escape, and any moment I play basketball is a good time.</p>

                <h3>Future Goals</h3>
                <p>My goal for the future is to go into project management, more specifically IT project management. I heard it pays very well, and if there is money 
                    in something, count me in. I also like the idea of leading a team.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts on the Class</h3>
                <p>To be completely honest, I don't really find coding that interesting, but so far this class has been very fun. I'm beginning to find coding kind of 
                    interesting. It's an amazing skill to have, even if I won't use it in my future workplace.</p>
