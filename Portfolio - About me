                <h2>I love playing basketball!</h2>
                    <p>I started playing basketball in 8th grade, from there I've never stopped. I've gotten much better at it over the years and even branched out new 
                        healthy hobbies because of it, such as weightlifting. I played basketball competitionally on my highschool team, and even played in an adult 
                        this past summer. I see it as an escape and any moment I play basketball is a good time.

                <h2>Future goals</h2>
                <p>My goal for the future is to go into project management, more specifically IT project management, I heard it pays very well and if there is money 
                    in something count me in. I also like the idea of being leading a team.

                <h2>Thoughts on the class</h2>
                <p>To be completely honest, I don't really find coding that intersting, but so far this class has been very fun, I'm beginning to find coding kind 
                    interesting. It's an amazing skill to have, even if I won't use it in my workplace in the future.
