                    <h3>Events Manager</h3>
                    <p>I am a volunteer events manager at my local mosque in Ajax. I work with a team and stay in close contact with
                        the head office when planning events. I've hosted events consisting of more than 100+ people before, and I love
                        every second of it. I have been volunteering for a little over a year now, and I have a lot of fun doing it.

                    <h3>Coding Projects</h3>
                    <p>Although I took a python class last year, I got a new laptop recently, so sadly all of my projects that 
                        were stored on my laptop got deleted. It's quite sad since I spent alot of time working on those projects, but 
                        there is no use worrying about it now, we look to the future!

                    <h3>Basketball League</h3>
                    <p>Another project that I am going to start within the comming months is launching a mens basketball league 
                        with a team of people. It's something that I am really excited to do, and I can't wait to apply my knowledge
                        from this course towards the league, such as building websites for the project etc.
